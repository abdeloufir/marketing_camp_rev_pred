# Marketing Campaign Conversion Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the conversion rates of marketing campaigns using machine learning techniques. By analyzing campaign data, we aim to build predictive models that help optimize marketing strategies.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Model building using Scikit-learn
- Performance evaluation of predictive models

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- jupyter

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn notebook
```

### Running the Project

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, navigate to the notebook file and run the cells to see the analysis and model training in action.
